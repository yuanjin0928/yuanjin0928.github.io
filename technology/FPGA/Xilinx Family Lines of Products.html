        Virtex family.
        Virtex-E family was introduced in 1999. After the release of Virtex-E, Xilinx on average releases new generation of Virtex device every two years, and each new generation of device is manufactured on new process technology.
        Virtex-5 was introduced in 2006.
        Since Virtex-5, Xilinx changed the logic fabric from 4-input LUTs to 6-input LUTs.
        Vritex-7 was introduced in 2010 on a 28 nm process technology.
        It is reported to deliver a two-fold system performance improvement at 50 percent lower power compared to previous generation Virtex-6 devices.
        In 2011, Xilinx began shipping sample quantities of the Virtex-7 2000T FPGA which adopts stacked silicon interconnect (SSI) technology.
        In 2012, using the same 3D technology, Xilinx introduced initial shipments of Virtex-7 H580T FPGA, a heterogeneous device.
        It comprises two FPGA dies and on 8-channel 28 Gbit/s transceiver die in the same package.

        With the introduction of its 28nm FPGAs, Xilinx replaced the high-volume Spartan family with the Kintex family and the low-cost Artix family.


        Kintex family.

        Artix family.

        Zynq family.
        Zynq-7000 integrate a complete ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore-processor-based 28nm system. 
        The Zynq architecture differs from previous marriages of programmable logic and embedded processors by moving from an FPGA-centric platform to a processor-centric model.
        In 2013, Xilinx introduced the Zynq-7100, which integrates digital signal processing (DSP) to meet emerging programmable systems integration requirements of wireless, broadcast, medical and military applications.

        The LUTs in 7 series FPGAs can be configured as either a 6-input LUT with one output, or as two 5-input LUTs with separate outputs but common addresses or logic inputs. 
        Each 5-input LUT output can optionally be registered in a flip-flop.
        Four such 6-input LUTs and their eight flip-flops as well as multiplexers and arithmetic carry logic form a slice, and two slices form a CLB.
        Four flip-flops per slice (one per LUT) can optionally be configured as latches.
        In that case, the remaining four flip-flops in that slice must remain unused.
